To learn about arrays and the way they function i thought was detailed in its own way, but then finding out that you can nest arrays into arrays?! 

Things got a little confusing.

Thankfully it just involved using what i already knew about this means of data collection in a much more intricate way of thinking. Still though, the ways to understand the index gets me a little shakey...

But hey, if all else fails (which im sure it wouldn't), asking a question to a collection of others coding will help out.
