I honestly feel like my entry will probably be like others. 

The ones expressing how they've always enjoyed messing with computers since a young age and they felt drawn to know how it worked or are just starting in making their own website, app, or program because using blogspot or tumblr got boring. Some maybe found themselves clicking "inspect element" on their broswer to see a big wall of gibberish words. Confused, they look into it and see a language not very common among humans. 

I guess i'll just make my reasoning short and sweet then.

I know my liking for creating things drew me personally to pursue further the realm of software development. it just seemed relatively fitting for me. i also desire it for specific uses i had planned for other mediums i do creatively. its going to be a considerable journey ahead i feel but i guess from my assumption before, im mostly likely not the only one taking the path to learn.
