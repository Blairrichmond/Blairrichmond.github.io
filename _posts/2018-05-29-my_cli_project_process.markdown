My first ever Learn porfolio project was definitely a long and tendious one. While the idea of what i had in mind and the logic i had to work with was easy, the process of developing it from the ground up took some getting used to and focusing on to solve the specific issued faced.

While getting the classes to cooperate with each other was one knot to untie, the biggest issue to make work would probably have to be the way my scraper took the HTML.

Making certain methods to get exact elements and utilizing detailed code to even print it! It was much to go through but i valued the time it took and the things i learned from the extensive debugging. Something i feel is the best way to understand how things work instead of looking at it through what is right. Seeing what makes it wrong then in turn will lead to the right solution being that you'd have to find it from what you previously didn't have.

Overall, this was a interesting experience of a project. Probably the first ever where i actually enjoyed failing just to get back to the right path with the proper conclusion. I just wonder how my other portfolio projects will fair as well.
