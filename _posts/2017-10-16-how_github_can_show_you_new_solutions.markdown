Coding doesnt have to be exact everytime. Ever successfully completed a test in learn but wanted to see how else it could have been solved? 

Github has the *solution* to that! 

Thanks to the other students before you, you are able to see the various ways others have tackled complex coding issues just like yours or even exactly similar on labs you've done. It was a great way to help me understand the vague applications of how you can go about certain processes to end up in the same destination. 

i always find these the best part about the learning experience. Not only since they can be of assistance to learning how things actually work with the answer, but just seeing the other ways people solve things can also encourage me to try and open my mind to possible new ways to code.
