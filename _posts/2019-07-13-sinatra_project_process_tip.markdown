The sinatra project for me was a nice process of work but there were tons of times I would have to rework my code to get things exactly how i wanted! 

One main thing to note is how you need to make sure everything is organized properly. Not just in directories, but also in the code itself. One thing i tried to keep in mind is to put the routes in order of appearence in your site for each get, post, and patch method. This keeps the flow of your code nice and tidy for reading and finding routes easily. 

I plan to update the interface more in terms of what you can do outside of the core basics so once I come back to it I'm sure there will be more things worth noting to tell the world about.
